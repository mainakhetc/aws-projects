Project 2: Serverless Contact Form with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and SES

Objective: Build a serverless backend for a contact form.
Website frontend (HTML form) hosted on S3/CloudFront (you already know from Project 1).


Backend:

API Gateway â†’ Accepts form submissions.

Lambda â†’ Processes the request.

Amazon SES â†’ Sends you an email notification with the form content.



Step 1: Prepare the Contact Form

Create an index.html with a simple form. 


Step 2: Create a Lambda Function

Go to AWS Lambda â†’ Create function.

Name: contactFormHandler.

Runtime: Python 3.13

Create the lambda_function python file.

Set Configurations â†’ Environment Variables â†’ Edit:

SENDER_EMAIL â†’ Your verified SES sender email.

RECIPIENT_EMAIL â†’ Your verified SES recipient email.


Step 3: Verify Emails in Amazon SES

Go to SES (Simple Email Service) â†’ Verified Identities.

Verify sender email and recipient email (both must be verified if SES is in sandbox mode).

Once verified, SES can send emails.


Step 4: Create API Gateway Endpoint

Go to API Gateway â†’ Create API â†’ HTTP API.

Add API Name - Contactless-form.

Add Integration - Select Lambda -> Select the Lambda function

Create a route with Method as Post, Resource Path as /contact & Integration target as contactFormHandler.

Integrate it with your Lambda function.

Deploy the API and copy the Invoke URL.

Replace "https://n6hlyvpqf1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/" in the HTML form script (index.html) with Invoke URL.


Step 5: Deploy and Test

Upload updated index.html to your S3 bucket.

Open your site â†’ Fill out the contact form.

You should get an email from SES with the message.
